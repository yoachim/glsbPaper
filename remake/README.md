Let's load up the old data and fit the stellar populations with something more modern

original stuff was in:
/Volumes/home/Backups/UW_inga/yoachim/Archive_scratch1/Research/GLSB

-----

Initial attempt had outer radii getting very large metallicities, which seems odd. 
Did get warnings about being near edges, so maybe expand that a bit.
